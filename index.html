        <img src="images/dundee.jpg" alt="Dundee Landscape">
        <p>Dundee was established by Peter Smith, with land contributed by his son in-law,
            in 1882 after the realisation that the valley was a natural way for travellers
             into the interior of Africa. Traders, hunters explorers, missionaries and soldiers 
             all made their way through here. A large fort, Fort Jones, 
             housed British troops in the area during the Anglo Zulu War of 1879. 
             The discovery of coal in the area dates from early Voortrekker records
              of 1838 and later geological surveys in the 1860s. </p>
