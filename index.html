        <p>Hello! My name is Don Mpangazitha, and I am From South africa, Durban. 
            I like hanging out with friends, playing soccer and so-on. I work as Artisan Bricklayer,
        for town-counsel in Dundee Municipality. I enrolled for Wed developer Program to improve my knowledge in technology.
        I love learning new things hence my passion for reading. My passion for hiking started when I 
        was invited by a friend to go mountain-hiking with her and some other mutual friends. Going up was hard but by after the hike I was looking 
        forward to doing it again and now I am always looking forward to more hiking trips. My greatest strength is determination. I believe with 
        God I can do anything, as long as I put effort and my mind to what I am doing. </p>

        <p>Dundee was established by Peter Smith, with land contributed by his son in-law,
            in 1882 after the realisation that the valley was a natural way for travellers
             into the interior of Africa. Traders, hunters explorers, missionaries and soldiers 
             all made their way through here. A large fort, Fort Jones, 
             housed British troops in the area during the Anglo Zulu War of 1879.</p>
